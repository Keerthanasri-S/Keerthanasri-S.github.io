Highway Collision Avoidance by Detection of Animal’s Images
============================================================

### Project Overview

This project proposes a *deep learning-based image recognition system* designed to detect animals on highways in order to *prevent vehicle-animal collisions. Leveraging computer vision, feature extraction, and classification techniques, the system aims to identify animals in real-time and provide **collision warnings to drivers*. It is designed to work efficiently even under varied conditions, such as different animal postures, lighting variations, and motion states.

### Tools & Technologies

- Deep Learning (CNN, DNN): For automated image-based animal recognition.
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Feature descriptor used in detection pipeline.
- K-Means Clustering: Used for image segmentation.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): For classification refinement.
- MATLAB: For implementing image preprocessing and algorithm testing.

### Design Features

- Detects animals in highway scenarios using *camera-mounted vehicles*.
- Capable of identifying *animal presence up to 20 meters ahead*.
- Incorporates *frame differentiation, gesture recognition, and **OpenCV-based motion analysis*.
- Classification includes preprocessing → segmentation (K-means) → feature extraction → classification.
- Accuracy comparison shows the proposed method outperforms traditional *HOG* and *HAAR* descriptors.

### Performance Summary

| Feature Descriptor  | Sensitivity | Specificity | Accuracy | Avg. Processing Time |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| HOG                 | 80.4%       | 83.5%       | 82.5%    | 100 ms               |
| HAAR                | 78.4%       | 77.8%       | 78.1%    | 150 ms               |
| Proposed Algorithm  | 83.9%       | 85.9%       | 85.5%    | 90 ms                |

### Applications

- *Highway Safety Systems* for real-time animal detection.
- *Wildlife Monitoring* through thermal/visible imaging.
- *Driver Assistance Systems* in smart vehicles.
- *Animal tracking systems* in agricultural and forest edge zones.
