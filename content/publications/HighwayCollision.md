Highway Collision Avoidance by Detection of Animal’s Images
============================================================

### Project Overview

This project proposes a *deep learning-based image recognition system* designed to detect animals on highways in order to *prevent vehicle-animal collisions. Leveraging computer vision, feature extraction, and classification techniques, the system aims to identify animals in real-time and provide **collision warnings to drivers*. It is designed to work efficiently even under varied conditions, such as different animal postures, lighting variations, and motion states.

### Tools & Technologies

- Deep Learning (CNN, DNN): For automated image-based animal recognition.
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Feature descriptor used in detection pipeline.
- K-Means Clustering: Used for image segmentation.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): For classification refinement.
- MATLAB: For implementing image preprocessing and algorithm testing.
