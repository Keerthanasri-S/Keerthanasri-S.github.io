Minimal JSON Parser in Java (Handwritten, No Libraries)
=========================================================

### Project Overview

This project presents a *minimal, handwritten JSON parser in Java, built from scratch without using any third-party libraries like GSON or Jackson. It operates fully from the **command-line*, manually performing tokenization, syntax validation, and parsing of .json files â€” ideal for educational purposes and foundational parser design.

### Tools & Technologies

- Java SE 11+: Core programming language for implementation.
- Manual Tokenizer and Recursive Parser: Built for handling nested structures.
- Command-line Execution: Lightweight, no graphical interface.
- File I/O: Reads .json files and outputs structured or error-highlighted results.

### Design Features

- Supports all standard JSON data types: objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
- Detects and reports *syntax errors* with precise line numbers and descriptions.
- Can handle *deeply nested* JSON structures using recursion.
- Option to *export* parsed output to .txt for further processing.
- Clean, modular code structure with custom exception handling (JSONException).

### Applications

- Educational tool for understanding parsing logic and JSON format.
- Lightweight file validator for .json data in scripting and automation.
- Foundation for building more advanced interpreters, config parsers, or compilers.
