CSRR Loaded Dual Band E-Shaped Slot Antenna for Biomedical Application
=======================================================================


### Project Overview



### Tools & Technologies

- **CST Studio Suite**: Used for simulation and electromagnetic analysis.
- **Metamaterial concepts**: Integration of CSRR for miniaturization and performance enhancement.
- **Rogers AD430 substrate**: For high-frequency stability and compact design.

### Design Features

- Operates at **2.4269 GHz** and **5.8404 GHz**, close to medical ISM bands.
- Compact volume of **25mm × 25mm × 1.08mm**, suitable for wearable and implantable devices.
- Incorporates **CSRRs** in the ground plane to improve impedance matching and bandwidth.
- Uses **Defected Ground Structure (DGS)** and **E-shaped slot** to enable multi-band response.
- Optimized for low **SAR** values for safe biomedical use.

### Applications

- Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs)
- Implantable and wearable health-monitoring devices
- Real-time biomedical telemetry systems
