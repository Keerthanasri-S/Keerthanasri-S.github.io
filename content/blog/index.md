I contributed to the `sjson` project by adding support for JSON boolean values like `true` and `false`. I introduced a `JsonBoolean` class and implemented character-by-character parsing using a helper method. Earlier, the parser failed to recognize booleans, but now it handles them correctly as per the JSON spec.

### Why Booleans Matter in JSON

Booleans (`true`, `false`) are core JSON values — lowercase, without quotes. Values like `"true"`, `1`, or `FALSE` are invalid as booleans. Supporting them is essential for reading any valid JSON structure.

### Parsing Logic in Brief

The parser checks input one character at a time. When it sees `t` or `f`, it tries to match the full word (`true` or `false`) using an `expect()` helper method. If any character doesn’t match, it throws an error — ensuring strict, spec-compliant parsing.
